```c
int x[2][128];
int i;
int sum = 0;

for (i = 0; i < 128; i++) {
  sum += x[0][i] * x[1][i];
}
```

A.

C = 512, E = 1, B = 16, S = 32

total read count: 2 * 128

x[0][i] address: i*4

x[1][i] address: (128+i)*4 = 512 + i*4

so x[0][i] and x[1][i] are cached into same block.

miss rate 100%

B.

C = 1024, E = 1, B = 16, S = 64

sizeof(x) == 2 * 128 * 4 == C

whole array can be cached.

miss rate is depended on block size B.

B = 16, sizeof(int) = 4, so

miss rate is 25%

C.

C = 512, E = 2, B = 16, S = 16

total read count: 2 * 128

x[0][i] address: i*4

x[1][i] address: (128+i)*4 = 512 + i*4

so x[0][i] and x[1][i] are cached into different block in same set.

in first half, all elements can be cached. miss rate is 25%.

```c
for (i = 0; i < 64; i++)
  sum += x[0][i] * x[1][i];
```

in second half 

```c
for (i = 64; i < 128; i++)
  sum += x[0][i] * x[1][i];
```

x[0][i] is not in cache. according to LRU strategy, cache x[0][i] into the
same block with x[0][i-64], cache x[1][i] into the
same block with x[1][i-64]. miss rate is 25%.

finally, miss rate is still 25%.

D.

No

if B is still 16, sizeof(int) = 4, block can only cache 4 int one time.

read int first time toggle memory cache, miss; next 3 time read hit.

25% miss rate is lowest.

E.

Yes

assume B = 32, block cache 8 int at one time.

only 1 miss in 8 time int read.

miss rate can be 12.5%.
