```c
FILE *fpin, *fpout;
fpin = fdopen(sockfd, "r");
fpout = fdopen(sockfd, "w");

// read and write

fclose(fpin);
fclose(fpout);
```
ref: 10.11

`fdopen` open 2 stream on same sockfd, `fdclose` will close sockfd under stream.
if you call `fclose` 2 stream on the same sockfd, the second `fclose` will fail.

image one thread execute code and open 2 stream on fd N. after execution of line
`fclose(fpin);`, program create another thread and execute the same code.

but

after `fclose(fpin);` in thread 1, fd N is reusable again. assume thread 2 use
the fd N again: thread 1 execute line `fclose(fpout);` close the fd that thread
2 is using. it'll cause something unpredicted.
