3.64

A.

3.1 in book

    T D[R][C];

    &D[i][j] = Xd + L(C*i + j)

    T means type, D means data, R means row, C means column

    L means sizeof(T), Xd means address of D

similarly, in 3d array

    TYPE D[R][S][T]

    &D[i][j][k] = Xd + L(S*T*i + T*j + k)

B.

```asm
!INCLUDE "./code/store-ele/store-ele.s"
```

base on comments,

    S * T = 65
    T = 13
    8*R*S*T = 3640

so

    R = 7
    S = 5
    T = 13
