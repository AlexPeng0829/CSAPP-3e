4.56

Problem mismatch with skeleton code, we follow the code here:
**change J_YES to UNCOND**

almost same like 4.55. main differences are

- pay attention to whether valC is greater or lower than valP
- pass both valC and valP back by M registers because if misprediction happens
    we need judge jumping back to valC or valP

check file `./chapter4/code/sim/pipe/pipe-btfnt.hcl`

only watch changes with origin pipe-btfnt.hcl

    (cd ./chapter4/code/sim/pipe; diff -u origin-pipe-btfnt.hcl pipe-btfnt.hcl)

```diff
!INCLUDE './code/sim/pipe/pipe-btfnt.diff'
```
