A.

4 \* 16 \* 16

B.

sizeof(point_color) == 16, B = 32

    square[i][j].c = 0

miss, cache 2 point_color, then

    square[i][j].m = 0
    square[i][j].y = 0
    square[i][j].k = 0
    square[i][j+1].c = 0
    square[i][j+1].m = 0
    square[i][j+1].y = 0
    square[i][j+1].k = 0

all hit

so miss count is 4 \* 16 \* 16 \* 1/8

C.

1/8
