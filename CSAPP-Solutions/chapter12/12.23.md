12.23

code in pic 12-8 save as file `12.23.bug.c`

run server

    (cd chapter12/code; make && ./12.23.bug)

let's figure out when server will fail, see code `12.23.client.c`

```c
!INCLUDE "./code/12.23.client.c"
```

line 20 `Close(clientfd)` are commented. when server is running, open another
terminal and run `./12.23.client`, server will exit with error

    Rio_readlineb error: Connection reset by peer

server can't read EOF because client doesn't call `Close`

how to fix:

just output error infomation and doesn't exit

```diff
!INCLUDE "./code/12.23.c.diff"
```
