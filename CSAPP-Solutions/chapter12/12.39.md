           as server      as client

proxy play with client as a server, with server as a client, interesting.

the key point is when normal situation

     +------+      +------+
     |      |----->|      |
     |client|      |server|
     |      |<-----|      |
     +------+      +------+

HTTP request from client is something like

    GET / HTTP/1.1
    Host: address:port

but with proxy, it'll be

    GET http://address:port/ HTTP/1.1
    Host: address:port

so proxy have to separate host from uri

A.

```c
!INCLUDE "./code/12.39/proxy.c"
```

B.

move process into thread function

```c
!INCLUDE "./code/12.39/proxy-thread.c"
```


how to benchmark:

run proxy

    (cd chapter12/code/12.39; make && ./proxy)
    # or
    (cd chapter12/code/12.39; make && ./proxy-thread)

open another terminal, start a local http server

    (python3 -m http.server 8000)

open one another terminal, benchmark

    # -X means proxy, -n means how many requests, -c means concurrent
    (ab -X localhost:5000 -n 100 -c 10 http://localhost:8000/)
